# Next Steps for GCP Fresh MCP

Based on the successful QA testing of the BigQuery MCP integration, here are the recommended next steps for the repository:

## ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Priorities

### 1. Bug Fixes
- [ ] **Fix `bq-list-datasets` tool** - Currently returns "Internal error"
  - Investigate the BigQuery API call implementation
  - Add proper error handling and response formatting
- [ ] **Improve error messages** - Replace generic "Internal error" with specific error details
  - Parse BigQuery API error responses
  - Return meaningful error messages to help debugging

### 2. Documentation Enhancements
- [ ] **Create comprehensive README** with:
  - Complete list of all 18+ BigQuery tools with examples
  - Known limitations and workarounds
  - Installation and configuration guide
  - Authentication setup instructions
- [ ] **Add EXAMPLES.md** with practical use cases:
  - Data warehouse setup
  - ETL pipeline examples
  - Session-based analytics
  - Batch vs streaming data ingestion

### 3. Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] **Add automated tests** for all BigQuery tools
  - Unit tests for individual functions
  - Integration tests with mock BigQuery responses
  - End-to-end tests with test project
- [ ] **Create CI/CD pipeline** with GitHub Actions
  - Run tests on PR
  - Automated deployment to Cloud Functions

## Priority Order

1. **Week 1-2**: Fix critical bugs (bq-list-datasets, error messages)
2. **Week 3-4**: Complete documentation and examples
3. **Month 2**: Add testing infrastructure and CI/CD
4. **Month 3**: Expand to additional GCP services
5. **Ongoing**: Performance optimizations and community building

## Success Metrics
